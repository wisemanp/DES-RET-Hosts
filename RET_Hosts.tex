\section{Introduction}



In the standard paradigm of stellar evolution, stars with a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass above $8M_{\sun}$ are believed to explode as a result of a catastrophic collapse of their iron cores and are known as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Since the turn of the century, observations of CCSNe have been supplemented by two rarer, more exotic transient classes. Long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), although first discovered in the 1960s \citep{Klebesadel1973} were only unequivocally linked to collapsing massive stars their associations with broad-lined type Ic SNe \citep{Galama1998,Hjorth2003}. Thought to be caused by accretion onto a newly-formed black hole at the centre of a collapsing, rapidly-rotating massive star \citep[][e.g.]{Woosley1993,Woosley1996a,Woosley1996b}, LGRBs comprise roughly $1\%$ of all SN Ic, themselves making up only 15\% of all CCSNe \citep{Kelly2012,Graham2016}.    and are roughly $10^4$ times rarer than  are thought and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe; e.g. \citealt{Quimby2011; Gal-Yam2012}) 

\section{Observations\label{sec:obs}}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\end{figure*}

\caption{The SFR of RET hosts, compared to CCSNe and the low-z SDSS sample.

\section{Analysis and results}
\label{sec:analysis} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.
